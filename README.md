# Global Warming's Effect on Hurricanes
The trends of hurricanes in recent years are believed to be increasing surpassed the strengths and amounts of previous accounts. Is global warming the reason why? Research gathered from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was analyzed in multiple forms to develop an understanding of the possible relationship between the pair. Global warming was perceived to have a striking, but a prominent connection to the numbers and strengths of hurricanes. As a result, the hurricane count and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) follows the format of a sine function. The impending, temporary decrease in storms will be very misleading, just like how global warming has been. This study is considered evidence of global warmingâ€™s effect on the recent increases in hurricane damages.
